My class assignments

JFloresLab9: a lab in which we tested different inputs and outputs that the code could do. For example, one such output was an audio test. 

JFloreslab8: in this lab we had to use code to load and import two images onto a canvas, that scaled with differnet mouse positions. We also had to write out text too.

JFlores7: with this lab we had to make an array that had a theme of Halloween, retro games, or nature. I decided to do a nature-like scene for my code.
